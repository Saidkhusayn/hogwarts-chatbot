Budgeting,Budgeting,"The list of expenses was built based on the extensive experience of organizers gained from previous cohorts and based on the advice of NewUU Authorities.
Based on the calculations, it has been concluded that in the best-case scenario (presents of good quality, food of good quality, and monetary reward for mentors for their 1-year contribution) approximately $87 will be needed to sustain 1 participant. For this reason, the amount of participants will depend on the collected budget, else participants without sponsorship coverage will need to self-fund their stay in the camp. The maximum capacity of the camp will be 200 participants.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ts4GgZwceCvPYl2c6mhz0gOzhcYgha9zPztz6x8sE3I/edit?usp=sharing
